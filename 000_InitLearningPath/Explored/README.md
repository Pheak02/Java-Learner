# JavaBeginner-WithColeb

The principle here is to understand every single line of the code!

//Class - contains everything - has members
//methods - do something
//arguments - what you pass to the method ( part of calling)
//parameter - Variables to store arguments (part of definition)
//Statement - telling the computer something
//properties - store something

//access modifer(public, private, protected) - who can see?
//static - No instance of class is needed
//object - instance of a class.

//variable - store some value
//expression - evaluate to a value
//operator(+) - work on operands to produce a value or which means combine things together  
 ex : System.out.println(string + ":)");
//operand - the things the operator works on
